# Pithy Dial Assembly Guide

#### What you will need:
* Soldering Equipment (obviously)
* 3mm Allen Key/Wrench
* Superglue

#### Recommended Soldering Equipment:
* Soldering Iron. Any iron will do.
* Solder. 2mm with flux works well.
* Holder. Ideally combining holding the iron and providing cleaner.
* 3rd Hand. Alternatively a rubber mat to provide friction.
